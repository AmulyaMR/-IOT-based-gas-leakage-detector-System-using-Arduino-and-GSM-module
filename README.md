An IoT-based Gas Leakage Detector System using Arduino and GSM module monitors harmful gases like LPG or methane via a gas sensor. On detecting leakage, it activates a buzzer for local alert and sends SMS notifications through the GSM module, enabling quick action to prevent fire, explosions, and ensure safety.
